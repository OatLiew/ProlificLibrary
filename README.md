The SWAG committee is looking for a way to track who has which book from our library. This is a simple app that connects to a web server and performs a GET, a POST, and a PUT. 

## Getting Started
Install Xcode via the appStore

### Get the code and dependencies:
**Open terminal and type in the following :**
- git clone https://github.com/OatLiew/ProlificLibrary.git
- cd ProlificLibrary
- pod install
- open ProlificLibrary.xcworkspace
